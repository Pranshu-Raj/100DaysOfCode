    1. Now the whole section is centered.
    2. The elements of the section is also centered.
    


## Difficulties

- Something happend with CSS.
    1. all the css animations and features are not showing up in features Sections.
        - Seriouly How can I do such a silly mistake. (The css file was copied outside the main folder and all the code changes happend their and I like a total dumbass looking for bugs in code.)

    2. Almost whole Day wasted in finding this stupid bug but now finally it is reloved.
